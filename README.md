# Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Active Queue Management

In this repository, I invesitgate the implementation of a DRL-based agent for dropping the packets in a queuing model. I use an stable version of [OpenAI baselines](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) for this purpose. The queuing simulation is implemented using MATLAB in [another repository](https://github.com/samiemostafavi/matlab-queuing-simulation).

## Setup

1. Install stable-baselines3
